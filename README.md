# Cascading failures in power grids
## Propagation and vulnerability analysis 

Project work for the PhD course in [Data Science for Networks](https://smartdata.polito.it/phd-course-data-science-for-networks/) at SmartData@PoliTO.

## Contents

1. **Report.pdf** is a report describing the problem, discussing the analysis and the results.
2. **Simulation.m** is MATLAB script that simulates the evolution of a cascade triggered by the removal of a line from a power network using MATPOWER, a free, open-source Electric Power System Simulation and Optimization Tool. It outputs the files "Topology.json" and "Cascade.json".
3. **Analysys.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code that performs analysis and data visualization.
